/**
 * XMLHelper is a simple utility for outputting indented XML markup. It escapes
 * all illegal XML characters using a custom (application-level) escaping
 * mechanism. The rationale behind this is to allow us to save such characters
 * (like from binary data in a project) into a project file and read them back
 * in again when loading a project.
 * <p>
 * Note that <i>all</i> data that passes through the methods in this class will
 * be escaped.  There is no check as to whether or not the illegal characters fall
 * in a CDATA section, a tag name, an attribute name or value, and so on.  We
 * consider this to be a reasonable simplification of the problem because illegal
 * XML characters are just that: Illegal.  If a tag name or attribute value contained
 * an illegal character, the resulting file would not be well-formed XML.  The fact
 * that this class escapes everything that goes through it won't break what would
 * otherwise be well-formed XML. It will only further mangle malformed XML!  Of
 * course, if the illegal characters fall in a CDATA section or attribute value,
 * the escaping will have saved the day. The results will be well-formed XML.
 * <p>
 * NB: When loading back in the data that was written using the XMLHelper, the
 * escaped characters will have to be 'unescaped' again after going through the
 * XML parser. See {@link #escape(String)} for a description of the escape
 * format.

    /**
     * Takes a String argument and returns a string that escapes characters that
     * are illegal in an XML document according to the XML specification. The
     * set of valid XML characters is taken from the <a
     * href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/">XML 1.0 specification</a>, section
     * 2.2. Additionally, the backslash character will be considered illegal if
     * it appears immediately before a lowercase u in the input string.
     * <p>
     * Illegal characters will be represented in the output in the "escaped
     * form," the string <tt>\\uNNNN</tt> where NNNN is the four-digit
     * hexadecimal value of the character. There will always be exactly four
     * characters following the \\u, and each of those four characters will be a
     * hex digit.
     * <p>
     * This escaping mechanism is not standard XML markup; it's
     * application-level data. No generic XML processor will unescape it on the
     * way in, so the job of unescaping lies with any application program that
     * wants to consume the XML data. The Architect handles this by wrapping a
     * SAX parser with a layer that detects and unescapes the \\u sequences.

     *            The input string that we want to check for illegal characters
     * @return Returns a string identical to the input string, except any

     *         characters will appear in the 6-character escaped form described
     *         above.
