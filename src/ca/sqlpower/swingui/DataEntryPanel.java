/**
 * The DataEntryPanel interface defines the contract between a panel
 * of components that help the user edit the data model and its parent
 * frame.  Classes that implement DataEntryPanel require that exactly
 * one of the two methods {@link #applyChanges()} or {@link
 * #discardChanges()} are called at the end of the panel's lifetime.
 * After affecting the model in the specified way, these methods will
 * free up resources associated with the panel (such as removing the
 * panel from listener lists).  After calling {@link #applyChanges()}
 * or {@link #discardChanges()} on an instance of DataEntryPanel, it
 * may not be used anymore.
 *
 * <p>Remember that it's important to call one of these methods
 * (usually discardChanges()) when a containing frame's window gets
 * closed by the native window system.
 * 
 * XXX: We do not like the name of this interface. Anyone who thinks
 * of a better one is encouraged to apply it. This used to be called
 * architect panel, but since it is being moved to the library, this
 * name no longer applies.
