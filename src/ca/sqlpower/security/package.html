    <h1>PL Security Overview</h1>

	<p>This document explains the security model that applies to all
	products in the Power*Loader suite.  The intended audience for
	this document includes product designers, programmers who work
	with the Power*Loader Suite, and power users and site
	administrators of the Power*Loader Suite who are interested in all
	the details of its security model.</p>

	<a name="objects"></a>
	<h2>Objects</h2>
	
	<p>An <i>object</i> in the Power*Loader security model is an
	entity which is stored in the PL Dictionary tables.  Users may
	interact with these objects subject to their privileges on them.</p>

	<p>Examples of objects include users, groups, Power*Loader ETL
	transactions, Power*Loader jobs, and Power*Dashboard KPIs.
	Another section in this document outlines the full set of object
	types, their official names, and which privileges apply to
	them.</p>

	  
	<a name="users"></a>
	<h2>Users</h2>
	
	<p>A <i>user</i> in the Power*Loader security model is an entity
	with a login name (also called the <i>user id</i>), an optional
	password, real name, email address, and various other
	product-specific flags.  A user is a type of object, so the same
	privilege and permission requirements apply to modifying user
	objects as to other types of objects (see below for specific
	permission explanations).</p>

	<p>In the database, a user is represented by one row in the
	PL_USER table.  The user id (login name) is stored in the USER_ID
	column, and the MD5 hash of the password is stored in the PASSWORD
	column (encoded as an ASCII string of the hexadecimal
	representation of the hash).  If a user's password in the PL_USER
	table is null, then application programs must accept any password
	(including blank) for that user.  This is useful for working in
	non-connection pooled mode.</p>

	<h3>Connection Pooling and Single Login</h3>

	<p>The web-based front ends work fastest and scale best when
	database connection pooling is employed.  For connection pooling
	to work effectively, all users must interact with the database
	through a single database user account which has full permissions,
	and therefore all privilege limits have to be enforced by the
	application (as opposed to being enforced by the database server's
	own security).</p>

	<p>When working in pooled (aka single login) mode in the web
	applications, it is important that each user in the PL_USER table
	has a non-null password (although this is not enforced).  However,
	when working in non-pooled mode, it is easiest for the system
	administrator if all user passwords are set to null: The user will
	supply their database user id and password, and the secondary
	password check will pass regardless of whether the database
	password has changed.</p>

	<p>Since the client/server applications never work in connection
	pooling mode, they always rely on the database authentication, and
	disregard the password column during login.</p>

	<h3>User System Privileges</h3>

	<p>System administrators and regular users with the necessary
	permissions (discussed below) can grant specific permissions on
	all objects of a certain type to specific users.  A user with
	these so-called <i>system privileges</i> is allowed to perform all
	specified operations on all objects of the given type.</p>


	<a name="user_object_privs"></a>
	<h3>User Object Privileges</h3>
	
	<p>System administrators and regular users with the necessary
	permissions (discussed below) can grant specific permissions on a
	specific object to a specific user.  Such a set of privileges is
	represented by a row in the USER_OBJECT_PRIVS table in the
	database.  These <i>object privileges</i> augment any system
	privileges which the user may also have on the object.  See the <a
	href="#determining_privs">Determining the Privilege Set</a>
	section for details.</p>


	<a name="groups"></a>
	<h2>Groups</h2>

	<p>A <i>group</i> is an entity which can have permissions on
	objects much like a user can have permissions on objects.  Zero or
	more users can belong to a group, and such users are referred to
	as the group's <i>members</i>.  All members of a group inherit all
	of the permissions which apply to that group.</p>

	<p>In the database, a group is represented by a row in the
	PL_GROUP table.  Group membership is expressed through rows in the
	USER_GROUP table, which associates user IDs to group names.</p>

	<p>There are two special group names: PL_ADMIN and PL_SUPERUSER.
	Membership in the PL_ADMIN group gives a user all permissions on
	all objects, and such a user is referred to as a system
	administrator.  Members of the PL_SUPERUSER group are allowed to
	bypass data restriction filters in the Power*Dashboard, and these
	users are referred to as omniscient users.</p>
	

	<a name="group_system_privs"></a>
	<h3>Group System Privileges</h3>

	<p>Group system privileges work much like user system privileges.
	System administrators and users with the necessary permissions can
	grant a permission set on a whole class of objects to a specific
	group.  Such a permission set is referred to as a <i>group system
	privilege</i>.</p>


	<a name="group_object_privs"></a>
	<h3>Group Object Privileges</h3>

	<p>A group object privilege works much like a user object
	privilege: It grants permission for a single group to perform a
	certain set of operations on a certain object.  These priveleges
	augment any system priveleges granted to the same group on all
	objects of a certain type.</p>



	<a name="determining_privs"></a>
	<h2>Determining the Effective Privilege Set</h2>

    <p>This section describes how to combine permissions of the various types 
    (<a href="user_system_privs">user system privileges</a>,
    <a href="user_object_privs">user object privileges</a>,
    <a href="group_system_privs">group system privileges</a>, and
    <a href="group_object_privs">group object privileges</a>; called the
    <i>specific permissions</i>) into the one privilege set that
    determines which actions a user can perform on a given object.
    This permission set is called the <i>effective privileges</i> on
    the given object.</p>

	<p>To determine the effective privilege set for a given object,
	applications take the logical OR of all applicable specific
	permission sets.  For instance, say user <code>FRED</code> belongs
	to groups <code>ETL_DEVELOPMENT</code> and
	<code>ETL_REPORTING</code>, and the following permissions are in place:</p>

	<table>
	  <tr><th colspan=8>Group System Privileges</th></tr>

	  <tr><th>Group Name</th><th>Object Type</th><th>Create Any</th><th>Modify Any</th><th>Delete Any</th><th>Execute Any</th><th>Grant Any</th><th>Notify Any</th></tr>

	  <tr><td>ETL_DEVELOPMENT</td> <td>TRANS</td> <td>Y</td>         <td>Y</td>         <td>N</td>         <td>Y</td>          <td>N</td>        <td>N</td></tr>
	  
	  <tr><td>ETL_REPORTING</td>   <td>TRANS</td> <td>N</td>         <td>N</td>         <td>N</td>         <td>Y</td>          <td>N</td>        <td>N</td></tr>
	</table>

	<table>
	  <tr><th colspan=8>Group Object Privileges</th></tr>

	  <tr><th>Group Name</th><th>Object Type</th><th>Object Name</th><th>Modify</th><th>Delete</th><th>Execute</th><th>Grant</th><th>Notify</th></tr>

	  <tr><td>ETL_DEVELOPMENT</td> <td>TRANS</td> <td>LOAD_POP</td>  <td>Y</td>      <td>Y</td>    <td>Y</td>      <td>N</td>    <td>N</td></tr>
	  
	</table>
