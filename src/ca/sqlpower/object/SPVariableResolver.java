/**
 * Defines all methods to implement to make an object capable of resolving
 * variables into actual values.
 * 
 * <p>Variables keys are {@link String} values and might be prefixed by a 
 * namespace value. Typically, the namespace will be a specific object UUID.
 * You can ask the resolver directly if he is capable of resolving variables
 * in a given namespace by calling {@link SPVariableResolver#resolvesNamespace(String)}.
 * 
 * <p>For example, one might expect an inserted variable to be something like:
 * 
 * <blockquote><code>${w1234-1234-1234-1234::myVariableKey}</code></blockquote>
 * 
 * <p>For performance reasons, it is strongly suggested of using those namespaces
 * and cache a map of namespaces<->resolvers. Large object models will benefit greatly
 * of this.
 *
 * <p>An inserted variable can also specify it's default value. This can be accomplished 
 * by inserting a variable as so.
 * 
 * <blockquote><code>${w1234-1234-1234-1234::myVariableKey->defValue}</code></blockquote>
 * 
 * <p>In the above example, the default value is a string which contents is 'defValue'.
 * 
 * <p>The usual way of using the Variables framework goes like this. {@link SPObject} that want
 * to expose variables must implement the {@link SPVariableResolverProvider} interface.
 * They then instanciate a variable resolver. One default implementation is available as 
 * {@link SPSimpleVariableResolver}. 
 * 
 * <p>The {@link SPSimpleVariableResolver} has a dual role. It is able to store and
 * update variables in a MultiMap. Multiple values can therefore be stored under a 
 * same variable key. It also implements the {@link SPVariableResolver} interface,
 * which allows it to share variable values with it's fellow objects.
 * 
 * <p>In order to search through the tree and resolve variables, one instanciates
 * a {@link SPVariableHelper} object and uses a specific node of the tree as a 
 * constructor argument. This node will serve as a starting point to resolve
 * variables. It will walk the tree and search for implementation of 
 * {@link SPVariableResolverProvider}. There are lots of options available to configure
 * the helper's behavior and optimize it's search routine. Read it's javadoc for more details.
 * 
 * @see {@link SPVariableHelper}
