 * {@link Accessor} and {@link Mutator} annotations within each {@link SPObject}
 * class. The {@link SPAnnotationProcessorFactory} should recognize this
 * annotation as a supported annotation type by the
 * {@link SPAnnotationProcessorFactory#supportedAnnotationTypes()} method. The
 * {@link SPAnnotationProcessor} needs to validate that a given method in
 * {@link SPObject} is tagged with this annotation before proceeding to generate
