 * This {@link Annotation} defines an {@link SPObject} class to be persistable
 * by an {@link SPPersister}. The {@link SPAnnotationProcessorFactory} should
 * recognize this annotation as a supported annotation type by
 * {@link SPAnnotationProcessorFactory#supportedAnnotationTypes()}. The
 * {@link SPAnnotationProcessor} needs to validate that a given {@link SPObject}
 * class is tagged with this annotation before proceeding to generate source
 * code for persister helpers. Since this annotation is {@link Inherited}, any
 * extending class of the annotated {@link SPObject} will also be deemed as
 * {@link Persistable}, so there is no need to annotate subclasses as
 * {@link Persistable}.
