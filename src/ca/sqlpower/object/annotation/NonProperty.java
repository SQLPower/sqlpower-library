/**
 * Each get method must be annotated with either an {@link Accessor} annotation
 * or a {@link NonProperty} annotation. Each set method must be annotated with
 * either a {@link Mutator} annotation or a {@link NonProperty} annotation. This
 * ensures that each getter and setter has been defined to be persisted or not.
 * A method marked as a {@link NonProperty} identifies that the property it
 * returns is not actually a property of the object but is a complex value, like
 * children, and will be ignored by persistence tests and other persistence
 * classes.
 * <p>
 * This annotation is retained at runtime for the benefits of tests only. There
 * will be no need to access this annotation at runtime when the app is running.
