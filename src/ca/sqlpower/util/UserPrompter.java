 * The UserPrompter interface is a UI-neutral way for core business objects to
 * solicit a response from the user. When operating in a GUI environment, the
 * UserPrompter implementation could use a modal dialog to prompt the user. When
 * operating in a command line environment, a textual prompt could be used. In a
 * headless environment where prompting is not possible, the responses can be
 * hardwired to a reasonable default. For example, the AlwaysOKUserPrompter
 * always responds as if the user said OK.
 * <p>
 * An example use case is when a file to be created but already exists. The
 * business logic can be implemented to ask the user how to handle the problem,
 * such as overwriting, not overwriting, or canceling the operation completely.
 * The advantage of using this interface is that the business logic remains
 * uncommitted to any particular user interface library.
