/**
 * The simplest possible Monitorable implementation. It simply starts with
 * reasonable defaults, which you can modify as much as you want. The getter
 * methods simply return the values you gave to the setter methods.
 * 
 * <p>
 * In order to guarantee reliable communication between threads using this
 * object, all methods are declared as synchronized.
 * 
 * <p>
 * This class will not be the best choice of Monitorable in many cases, but it
 * is certainly useful in cases where the work being carried out is shared
 * between several classes. They can pass an instance of this class between
 * them, and the ProgressWatcher will still have a single Monitorable to poll
 * for progress.
 * 
 * <p>The "Reasonable" defaults are:
 * <ul>
 *  <li>progress = 0
 *  <li>jobSize = null (means not yet determined)
 *  <li>message = null
 *  <li>started = false
 *  <li>cancelled = false
 *  <li>finished = false
 * </ul>
