	/**
	 * Creates a new user prompter instance with the given settings. User
	 * prompter instances can be stateful (for example, an "always accept"
	 * button will cause that prompter to continue returning "OK" forever), so
	 * it is important to obtain a new user prompter from this factory for every
	 * overall operation.
	 * 
	 * @param question
	 *            The question the new prompter will pose when solociting a
	 *            response from the user. This question string is not exactly
	 *            plain text: it is formatted according to to rules laid out in
	 *            the {@link MessageFormat} class. The most important
	 *            implications are that the single quote (') character and the
	 *            open curly brace ({) characters are special and have to be
	 *            escaped in order to appear in the message. The other important
	 *            thing (the benefit, that is) is that constructions of the form
	 *            {0} are placeholders that will be substituted every time the
	 *            question is asked via the
	 *            {@link UserPrompter#promptUser(Object[])} method is called.
	 *            See {@link MessageFormat} for details.
	 *            <br>
	 *            Also, UserPrompter implementations will ensure that newline
	 *            characters (\n) show up as new lines when the question is
	 *            presented to the user.<p>
	 * @param responseType
	 *            The object type that will be returned by the prompter.<p>
	 * @param optionType
	 * 			  The combination of responses to be used to prompt the user<p>          
	 * @param defaultResponse
	 *            The response object to use as a default. The default will be
	 *            used to specify the default selection for user interactive
	 *            prompters or it will be the returned value if the selection is
	 *            automatic.<p>
	 * @param buttonNames
	 * 			  An array of strings of an indefinite size which will be used 
	 * 			  as labels for each of the responses. The strings should be stored 
	 * 			  in the array in the order indicated by the optionType. If the number
	 * 			  of strings in the array does not match the number of responses required 
	 * 			  for each optionType, an IllegalStateException will be thrown.
	 * 			  The following are currently the types of strings used:<br>
	 * 		      1)okText<br>
	 *            The text to associate with the OK response. Try to use a word
	 *            or phrase from the question instead of a generic word like
	 *            "OK" or "Yes".<br>
	 *            2)newText<br>
	 *            The text to associate with the NEW response. Try to use a word
	 *            or phrase from the question instead of a generic word like
	 *            "NEW" or "Yes". This action should create an appropriate new
	 *            object.<br>
	 *            3)notOkText<br>
	 *            The text to associate with the "not OK" response. Try to use a
	 *            word or phrase from the question instead of a generic word
	 *            like "No".<br>
	 *            4)cancelText<br>
	 *            The text to associate with response that cancels the whole
	 *            operation.<br>
