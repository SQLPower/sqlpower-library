/**
 * This graph takes a {@link WabitObject} for its root and makes a graph
 * model that represents all of the root's dependencies. The root is
 * included in the dependencies. The children can be included or the graph
 * can just be of the dependencies. If the children are not included in the
 * graph then the parents will replace their children when adding edges.
 * <p>
 * Example:<br>
 * If we have a workspace with a report, chart, query, and 2 data sources 
 * the parent tree would look like the following
 * <pre>
 *                       Workspace
 *                           |

 *                                          CR1   CR2
 * </pre>
 * Where a DS is a data source, a CB is a content box and a CR is a content renderer.<br>
 * If we said the Query was based on DS1, the Chart was based on the Query, and the Report
 * was displaying the Chart in CB1 and the Query in CB2 we would have dependencies between
 * the WabitObjects. With dependencies the tree would look like the following<br>
 * <img src="doc-files/ProjectGraphModel-1.JPG"><br>
 * If a graph is made with the report node as the root you will have a graph of the following
 * <pre>
 *             Report
 *               |
 *               |
 *               |
 *              Page
 *               |
 *          ----------------------------
 *         /                      |     \
 *        CB1                    CB2   CB3
 *         |                      |

 *         |                      |

 *      ---------                DS1
 *     /    |    \
 *   Col1  Col2  Col3
 * </pre>
 * If a graph is made without the children of objects being included in the graph
 * the result will look like the following
 * <pre>
 *            Report
 *              |
 *         -----------
 *        /           \
 *     Chart-------->Query
 *                     |
 *                    DS1
 * </pre>
 * If we look at a graph without the objects children, just the dependencies, with
 * the query as the root we will get the graph
 * <pre>
 *    Query
 *      |
 *     DS1
 * </pre>
 * If we then reverse the polarity on the graph above we get
 * <pre>
 *              Query
 *                |
 *           -----------

     *            to the child object for parent/child edges, and dependencies
     *            edges will go from the object that is dependent on an object
     *            to the object being depended on. If this is true then the
     *            edges in the graph will be reversed so the children of objects
     *            will have an edge pointing to their parent and objects being
     *            depended on will point to the objects that depend on them.
